Clues on WTAF is meant to happen & how to demonstrate it ...

Based on (effectively a copy of) spring.io starter guide at
    http://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-web-service/


On clean there will be lots of red.  Compile will auto-generate the stuff to fix it in
    target\classe\hello\wsdl

They will be in bit code and no point amending as the get blitzed each time anyway
NOTE : need the wsdl to be available (probably easiest to have soapCountryServer running on 8080.  Need to change the POM
if we change where to look for the WSDL (perhaps to a local copy)

All this does is grab a country object from the server and create a stringified version
